# MusicPlayerApp

This app has a music player made by scratch with css and React Typescript.

The music datas basicly comes from a json file in the source code.
One song link is lead to a music from google drive shared link.

I've made this app to have fun so feel free to use and give critics about it.

I also build this app to netlify you can check from here.
